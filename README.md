<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

DIControls is a library for Angular for creating reusable, flexible UI controls using
a declarative approach.

By using it, you can create your own UI components in a matter of seconds and extend them
without additional code changes. To learn more, please refer to our documentation.

Why you should try:

- ðŸ˜ƒ Creating a new control takes just a few seconds.
- ðŸ§¼ Your component code remains clean and contains only the necessary business logic.
- ðŸ”„ Controls by default support working with `NgModel` and `FormControl`.
- ðŸš€ Created controls can be reused, extended, and provided with these capabilities to your users.
- ðŸ§© To connect one control to another, simply nest it inside the tag!
- ðŸ§ª They are already covered by tests, so cover only code that you write.
